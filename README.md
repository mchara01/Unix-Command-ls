## ls -ialR
Implementation of a subset of functions of the ls command, namely the (-ialR) arguments, without the use of the exec command family. The program allows users to set the maximum depth of recursion (which is not provided by the standard ls command). The ls command represents the contents of a directory given as a parameter. If the user fails to give a parameter then the command automatically displays the contents of the "." directory (current directory). The user also has the ability to pass multiple files as arguments. In this case, they will present the contents of all user-defined directories. More details of the command and the aforementioned arguments can be seen at the image below.
